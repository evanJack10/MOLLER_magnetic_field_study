# MOLLER magnetic field study
Collection of scripts that facilitate the study of the magnetic field for the MOLLER experiment using optics analysis

## Setting up your virtual environment
To build the virtual environment for python start in the base directory (MOLLER_magnetic_field_study) and type the following:
```
!/bin/bash
source setup.csh
```

After the first time you set up your virtual environment, you should do the following:
```
!/bin/bash
source sourceme.csh
```
If you need to install more python modules, e.g. pyperclip, use the following command:
```
pip3 install pyperclip
```
